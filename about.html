            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>As an enthusiastic and determined student at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics, I'm driven by a desire to learn more about technology and a relentless commitment to personal and professional growth.

                Two invaluable internships have enriched my journey as a student. At Sandhills Global, I had the privilege to contribute as a Software Engineer Intern. There, I honed my coding skills and collaborated on projects that fueled my passion for software development. My time at Kiewit, as a Field Engineer Intern, provided me with hands-on experience in the construction industry, where I learned the importance of effective communication and project management.
                
                I'm eager to continue expanding my knowledge, seeking opportunities to leverage technology and mathematics to make a meaningful impact. Whether it's creating efficient software solutions or tackling real-world challenges in the field, I'm excited about the endless possibilities that lie ahead.</p>
